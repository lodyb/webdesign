# webdesign
Here is where I'll stash my random web designs.

Most of these will remain unfinished. This is a side project where I like to experiment with front end technologies and techniques to build up a repertoire of assets.

I'll do my best to keep these portable, opting for remote stock imagery and CDN assets over tools like Bower and NPM.
